# Library Management System

This project is a simple Library Management System written in Java that allows you to perform CRUD operations on Book, Author and Publisher data stored in CSV files. I used the console for the UI to allow the user to interact with the application. While doing this project I learned how to implement the MVC structural design pattern. All the business logic was performed in the Service layer, and the DAO layer was used for only reading and writing to the CSV files.
